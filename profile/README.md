# Platinum Hub

Welcome to the Platinum Hub development organisation (@Platinum5Hub). This organization has currently no public repositories, as our main project (PH) is hidden for now. It will be open sourced when it gets to a state where it works. It is currently being developed with Tauri v1, using TypeScript & React for the frontend, and Supabase for the accounting system.

This organisation is dedicated to developing a project for the [Blackhawk Rescue Mission 5 (BRM5)](https://www.roblox.com/games/2916899287/Blackhawk-Rescue-Mission-5) community. The aim is to create a simple place to have features and content tailored specifically for BRM5 enthusiasts - in other words - faction players. Platinum Hub is meant to be a simple yet powerful toolset for BRM5 factions.

Please note that this project is **not an official initiative**. It is an independent project created by myself. As such, it is still a work in progress (WIP), with ongoing development.

Thank you for stopping by! Stay tuned for updates and announcements regarding the progress of this project.

> ###### PS: In the case you found this somewhere (as I am not advertising it at all), please do not get hyped: there's no guarantee of me finishing this. I'm still a novice at coding and not all the "cool" projects I start get finished. I love this idea and will try my best, but just in case, don't get too excited. Thanks for understanding.
